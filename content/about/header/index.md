<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am a mycologist at NC State University who studies plant-fungal interactions across the spectrum of symbiosis. As a plant pathologist by training, I am interested in how vast knowledge of plant-pathogen interactions can inform our understanding of microbial communities and their impact on plant hosts. As plant pathology is anchored in understanding of the host, the pathogen, and the environment, I am also curious as to how environment shapes microbial communities associated with plants, especially in the context of climate change.
