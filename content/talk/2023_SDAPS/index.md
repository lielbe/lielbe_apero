title: Does drought stress influence wheat seed fungal populations over generations?
---

### ABSTRACT

Wheat (*Triticum aestivum*) is a staple global food crop. In 2021, US wheat growers experienced extreme weather events that reduced crop productivity. Our research examines the influence of drought stress imposed post-flowering on seed fungal communities. We hypothesize that moderate drought stress imposed on wheat plants over consecutive generations will have a greater impact on abundance rather than presence/absence of fungal taxa compared to control plants. To test this hypothesis, untreated seeds were harvested and sourced from three winter wheat cultivars (Catawba, USG-3640, and Shirley). Seedlings of each cultivar were grown in an environmental chamber at NC State. Plants (n=18) were exposed to moderate drought (\~45% plant available water) for one week after achieving 90% flowering to simulate late season drought conditions. ITS sequence-based analysis of Generation 1 (G1) and Generation 2 (G2) wheat seeds was used to determine fungal taxa presence and abundance for each cultivar. We observed a significant increase in Shannon diversity for G2 plants compared to G1 plants irrespective of treatment (P \<2e-16). Research is underway to better understand the relative impact of moderate drought stress on the wheat seed mycobiome and to identify key fungal taxa associated with drought legacy over generations.
