<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I'm a mycologist recently defended my Ph.D. at NC State University. My research interests include exploring the intersection of symbiosis between fungi and their host. I work on projects that use classical microbial ecology techniques to study these relationships when the host is a plant (Calibrachoa, Tomato, or Wheat). Learn more about my research interests [here](/project).
