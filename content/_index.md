description: I am a plant pathologist with a passion for exploring the intricate relationships between crops and their microbiomes, particularly under biotic or abiotic stress conditions. My ambition is to bridge the gap between basic microbiome research and practical agricultural solutions, aiming to enhance crop resilience through the strategic selection of microbiomes. My research combines microbial ecology, genomics, and plant pathology to improve our understanding of host-microbe interactions. I am currently a Postdoctoral Scholar at [Oregon State University](https://bpp.oregonstate.edu/users/lindsey-becker) working with [Dr. Posy Busby](https://agmicrobiome.org/) and Dr. Chris Mundt.
